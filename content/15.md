In this blog, we will explore hyperledger foundation and its projects. In future, we will create projects using hyperledger tools before that it would be good to have the background of hyperledger foundation and its projects. This blog is basically revision notes of a Hyperledger course I took on edx. I will try to cover the key points and concepts of the course. I hope you will find it useful.

## What is Hyperledger?

Hyperledger is an open source collaborative effort created to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies. It is a global collaboration, hosted by The Linux Foundation, including leaders in finance, banking, Internet of Things, supply chains, manufacturing and Technology.

We all know the importance of blockchain technology and its potential to change the way we do business. Currently, we are in the early stages of blockchain adoption and there are many challenges to overcome. Hyperledger is an effort to address these challenges and to make blockchain technology ready for the enterprise.

But the question is why we need hyperledger? There are many blockchain platforms available in the market like Ethereum, Bitcoin, Ripple, etc. Then why we need hyperledger?

## How is Hyperledger different?

Well, the answer is variable requirements of different industries. If we see the features of Ethereum, it is designed for public blockchain with transparency, secure and decentralized network. But what if we need some kind of privacy, permissioned mining, and other features? This is where hyperledger comes into the picture.

#### Key differences with Hyperledger:

1. **Permissioned Network**: Hyperledger is designed for permissioned networks. It means that only known and trusted participants can join the network. This is important for enterprises where privacy and security are the main concerns.
2. **Pluggable Consensus**: Hyperledger provides a pluggable consensus algorithm. It means that we can select the consensus algorithm based on our requirements. We can use PoW, PoS, PBFT, etc. For example, Fabric uses PBFT, Sawtooth uses PoET, etc.
3. **Privacy and Confidentiality**: Hyperledger provides privacy and confidentiality. It means that we can control who can see the transactions and who can participate in the network.
4. **Collaboration**: Hyperledger is a open source project and anyone can contribute to it. By allowing collaboration, it is possible to ensure that the projects are up to date with the latest technologies and requirements.
5. **Modularity**: Hyperledger is designed to be modular. It means that we can use the components that we need and ignore the rest. This is important because we can use the components that are required for our project and ignore the rest.
6. **Cryptocurrency**: Hyperledger is not designed for cryptocurrency. It means that we can use hyperledger for various use cases without worrying about the cryptocurrency.

## Project requirements

When we are thinking of using a DLT solution for a project, we need to consider various factors such as:

1. Security: How secure is the network?
2. Privacy: How much privacy is required?
3. Scalability: How scalable the network should be?
4. Performance/Speed: How fast the network should be?
5. Decentralization: How much decentralization is required?
6. Carbon Footprint: How much energy consumption is acceptable?
7. Interoperability: How the network will interact with other networks?
8. Governance: How the network will be governed?
9. Legal and Regulatory Compliance: How the network will comply with legal and regulatory requirements?

Based on this requirement, we can select what type of blockchain will be suitable public or private, what should be the consensus algorithm, etc.
Consensus is a basic aspect of blockchain technology. It is a process of achieving agreement among the nodes in a distributed network.

The various types of consensus algorithms are:

- Proof of Work (PoW)
- Proof of Stake (PoS)
- Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)
- Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
- Proof of Authority (PoA)
- Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET)

You can read more about these consensus algorithms [here](https://www.persistent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WP-Understanding-Blockchain-Consensus-Models.pdf) or any other source.

### Blockchain Trilemma

The blockchain trilemma is a term used to describe the trade-offs between security, scalability, and decentralization. It is difficult to achieve all three at the same time. For example, if we want to achieve high security and decentralization, we may have to compromise on scalability. Similarly, if we want to achieve high scalability and decentralization, we may have to compromise on security.

So when we are selecting a blockchain platform, we need to consider these trade-offs and select the platform that best fits our requirements.

## Hyperledger Projects

Well now we have some idea about the requirements and consensus algorithms. Let's see what hyperledger projects are available to fulfill these requirements.

Hyperledger has a number of projects under its umbrella. Each project is designed to fulfill different requirements of different industries. You can find the list of projects [here](https://dltlandscape.hyperledger.org/projects).
